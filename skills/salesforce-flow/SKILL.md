## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create any type of Flow (Screen, Autolaunched, Record-Triggered, Scheduled)
- Generate Flow metadata XML
- Automate business processes without code
- Build user-guided workflows or background automation
- Troubleshoot deployment errors related to Flows

## Specification

# Flow Metadata Specification

## 📋 Overview
Salesforce Flows are powerful automation tools that enable complex business process automation without code. Flows can collect and process data through interactive screens, execute logic and calculations, manipulate records, call external services, and trigger based on various events. Flow types include Screen Flows (user-guided), Autolaunched Flows (background processing), Record-Triggered Flows (database events), Scheduled Flows (time-based), and Platform Event-Triggered Flows (event-driven).

## 🎯 Purpose
- Automate complex business processes with declarative logic and branching
- Guide users through multi-step data collection and decision workflows via Screen Flows
- Perform CRUD operations on Salesforce records automatically
- Execute background processing and integrations via Autolaunched Flows
- React to record changes in real-time with Record-Triggered Flows
- Schedule recurring tasks and batch operations with Scheduled Flows
- Create reusable, maintainable automation that admins can modify without code

## ⚙️ Flow Generation Pipeline

**🚨 MANDATORY: You MUST follow this exact 3-step pipeline. No exceptions. No shortcuts. No skipping steps. Do NOT manually create flow metadata XML or attempt to generate flow metadata outside of this pipeline. Do NOT attempt to use any other tool, API, or method to generate flow metadata. This pipeline is the ONLY supported way to generate flows. Any deviation will produce invalid or broken metadata.**

Flow generation is a **strict 3-step pipeline**. ALL steps must be called in order. Every step is required. **There is no alternative approach — this is the only way to generate flow metadata:**

### Step 1 (REQUIRED): Fetch Grounded Object Metadata (`fetchGroundedObjectMetadata`)
Fetches org schema metadata relevant to the flow generation request. This step is **mandatory** and must always be called first.

**Inputs (all required):**
- **userPrompt** (STRING, REQUIRED): The user's natural language request
- **inflightMetadata** (ARRAY, REQUIRED): Custom objects/fields from local sfdx project. Use empty array `[]` if none needed.

**Outputs:**
- **groundingMetadata** (STRING): Grounded object metadata for org schema relevant to the request, returned as a JSON string. **You must pass this directly to Step 2 — it is already a string and does not need to be serialized again.**

### Step 2 (REQUIRED): Flow Element Selection (`flowElementSelection`)
Selects flow elements (assignments, decisions, record ops, etc.) and their connections based on the user prompt and grounded metadata. This step is **mandatory** and must be called after Step 1.

**Inputs (all required):**
- **userPrompt** (STRING, REQUIRED): The user's natural language request (**must be the same value as Step 1**)
- **groundingMetadata** (STRING, REQUIRED): Org schema metadata (**must be the exact string returned from Step 1 output** — pass it directly, do NOT serialize it again)
- **operationId** (STRING, REQUIRED): Operation ID (use empty string `""` for first call)

**Outputs:**
- **operationId** (STRING): Operation ID. **You must pass this to Step 3.**
- **userOutput** (STRING): Reasoning for next steps. You can show this to the user.

### Step 3 (REQUIRED): Flow Element Generation (`flowElementGeneration`)
Generates flow metadata element by element. This step is **mandatory** and must be called after Step 2. **Must be called repeatedly in a loop until `isComplete` is `true`.**

**Inputs (all required):**
- **operationId** (STRING, REQUIRED): Operation ID **from Step 2 output**
- **requestSource** (STRING, REQUIRED): The source of the request. Use **`"A4V"`** to get flow metadata in XML format.

**Outputs:**
- **isComplete** (BOOLEAN): Indicates if the flow generation is complete. **You must check this value.**
- **result** (STRING): Result of the flow element generation. Contains the final flow metadata **only when `isComplete` is `true`**.

**🚨 MANDATORY: Loop until complete.**
- Call `flowElementGeneration` with the `operationId` from Step 2 and `requestSource` (use `"A4V"` for XML output, empty string or other value for JSON).
- Check the `isComplete` output after each call.
- If `isComplete` is `false`, you **MUST** call `flowElementGeneration` again with the **same `operationId`** from Step 2.
- **Do NOT stop** until `isComplete` is `true`.
- When `isComplete` is `true`, extract the flow metadata from the `result` field.

## 📦 inflightMetadata Format
**DATA TYPE: ARRAY (not string)**

**⚠️ STRICT NAMING CONVENTION - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:**
| Property | Correct Name | ❌ Do NOT Use |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Object API name | `apiName` | `objectApiName`, `name`, `objectName` |
| Field API name | `apiName` | `fieldApiName`, `name`, `fieldName` |
| Field type | `type` | `fieldType`, `dataType` |
| Lookup target | `referenceTo` | `relatedTo`, `lookupTo`, `reference` |

When custom objects are needed (sample format showing multiple field data types):
```json
[
  {
    "type": "CustomObject",
    "apiName": "CustomerRequest__c",
    "label": "Customer Request",
    "fields": [
      {
        "apiName": "Status__c",
        "type": "Picklist",
        "label": "Status",
        "values": ["New", "In Progress", "Completed"]
      },
      {
        "apiName": "Priority__c",
        "type": "Number",
        "label": "Priority"
      },
      {
        "apiName": "AssignedTo__c",
        "type": "Lookup",
        "label": "Assigned To",
        "referenceTo": "User"
      },
      {
        "apiName": "Description__c",
        "type": "Textarea",
        "label": "Description"
      },
      {
        "apiName": "Email__c",
        "type": "Email",
        "label": "Contact Email"
      },
      {
        "apiName": "DueDate__c",
        "type": "Date",
        "label": "Due Date"
      },
      {
        "apiName": "IsUrgent__c",
        "type": "Boolean",
        "label": "Is Urgent"
      },
      {
        "apiName": "Amount__c",
        "type": "Currency",
        "label": "Amount"
      }
    ],
    "relationships": []
  }
]
```

**Supported field types**: Text, Textarea, Number, Picklist, Lookup, Email, Phone, URL, Date, Datetime, Boolean, Checkbox, Currency, Percent

When no custom objects needed:
```json
[]
```

### ⚠️ MANDATORY Decision Logic for inflightMetadata (DATA TYPE: ARRAY)

1. **REQUIRED - First**: Scan the local sfdx project for custom objects and fields that are relevant to the user's flow request.
2. **If relevant custom objects ARE found**: You MUST extract and pass them as an array of structured objects (see format above)
3. **If NO relevant custom objects found**: You MUST pass an empty array `[]` (NOT the string `"[]"`)
4. **NEVER**: Pass text descriptions, instructions, or string representations in inflightMetadata
5. **MANDATORY**: The data type MUST be ARRAY, not STRING

**Instructions for Cline when custom objects ARE relevant:**
- Extract the object metadata and map to JSON properties:
    - `apiName`: The object's API name (with `__c` suffix for custom objects)
    - `label`: The object's display label
    - `type`: Set to `"CustomObject"`
    - `fields`: Array of field objects, each containing:
        - `apiName`: The field's API name (with `__c` suffix for custom fields)
        - `type`: The field type (Text, Number, Picklist, Lookup, etc.)
        - `label`: The field's display label
        - `values`: (Picklist only) Array of picklist values
        - `referenceTo`: (Lookup only) The target object API name
- Include only objects and fields that are relevant to the flow being generated

## 🎯 Mandatory Enhancement Rules
- **userPrompt**: REQUIRED. Always use the exact user prompt without modification.
- **inflightMetadata**: REQUIRED. Always use ARRAY data type.
    - MUST use `[]` (empty array) when no custom objects needed
    - MUST use structured array of objects when custom objects are relevant
    - NEVER use string `"[]"` - this is incorrect
    - NEVER use text descriptions - only structured object metadata

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Multiple Flows = Multiple Separate Pipelines

**❌ NEVER club multiple flow prompts into a single `userPrompt` field.**

When the user requests multiple flows (e.g., for an app with several flows), each flow MUST be generated with a **separate 3-step pipeline** and a **separate payload**. This is mandatory and non-negotiable.

**❌ WRONG - Multiple flows clubbed into one userPrompt:**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Generate the following flows: 1) Screen Flow - Tenant Onboarding... 2) Autolaunched Flow - Generate Checklist... 3) Record-Triggered Flow - Sync Unit...",
  ...
}
```

**✅ CORRECT - Separate call for EACH flow:**

**Flow 1 - Step 1 (fetchGroundedObjectMetadata):**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Create a Screen Flow named Tenant_Onboarding that captures tenant details, selects a Unit__c with Status__c = 'Vacant', creates Lease__c...",
  "inflightMetadata": [...]
}
```
Then call Step 2 (`flowElementSelection`) with the `groundingMetadata` from Step 1, then Step 3 (`flowElementGeneration`) with the `operationId` from Step 2.

**Flow 2 - Step 1 (fetchGroundedObjectMetadata):**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Create an Autolaunched Flow named Generate_Onboarding_Checklist that given a Lease__c Id input, queries OnboardingTask__c...",
  "inflightMetadata": [...]
}
```
Then call Step 2 and Step 3 for this flow.

**Flow 3 - Step 1 (fetchGroundedObjectMetadata):**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Create a Record-Triggered Flow named Sync_Unit_On_Lease_Changes that on insert and update of Lease__c...",
  "inflightMetadata": [...]
}
```
Then call Step 2 and Step 3 for this flow.

**Mandatory Rules:**
- If there are N flows to generate, there MUST be N separate 3-step pipelines. No exceptions.
- For each flow, you MUST scan the local sfdx project to populate `inflightMetadata` with custom objects/fields **specific to that flow prompt**.
- Each flow pipeline MUST have its own `inflightMetadata` containing only the objects/fields relevant to that particular flow.

## 🔧 Example Tool Calls

**Example 1: Standard objects only (no custom objects)**

**Step 1 - fetchGroundedObjectMetadata:**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Create a scheduled-triggered Flow named Daily_Good_Morning that runs daily at 6:00 AM and sends an email to the running user saying good morning.",
  "inflightMetadata": []
}
```

**Step 2 - flowElementSelection:**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Create a scheduled-triggered Flow named Daily_Good_Morning that runs daily at 6:00 AM and sends an email to the running user saying good morning.",
  "groundingMetadata": "<groundingMetadata string from Step 1 — pass directly, do not serialize again>",
  "operationId": ""
}
```

**Step 3 - flowElementGeneration (call in a loop):**
```json
{
  "operationId": "<operationId from Step 2>",
  "requestSource": "A4V"
}
```
Call repeatedly with the same `operationId` until `isComplete` is `true`. When `isComplete` is `true`, extract the flow metadata from the `result` field. Use `"requestSource": "A4V"` to get flow metadata in XML format.

**Example 2: With custom objects from local sfdx project**

**Step 1 - fetchGroundedObjectMetadata:**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Create a flow that updates the status of a Customer Request when it's assigned",
  "inflightMetadata": [
    {
      "type": "CustomObject",
      "apiName": "CustomerRequest__c",
      "label": "Customer Request",
      "fields": [
        {
          "apiName": "Status__c",
          "type": "Picklist",
          "label": "Status",
          "values": ["New", "In Progress", "Completed"]
        },
        {
          "apiName": "AssignedTo__c",
          "type": "Lookup",
          "label": "Assigned To",
          "referenceTo": "User"
        }
      ],
      "relationships": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2 - flowElementSelection:**
```json
{
  "userPrompt": "Create a flow that updates the status of a Customer Request when it's assigned",
  "groundingMetadata": "<groundingMetadata string from Step 1 — pass directly, do not serialize again>",
  "operationId": ""
}
```

**Step 3 - flowElementGeneration (call in a loop):**
```json
{
  "operationId": "<operationId from Step 2>",
  "requestSource": "A4V"
}
```
Call repeatedly with the same `operationId` until `isComplete` is `true`. When `isComplete` is `true`, extract the flow metadata from the `result` field. Use `"requestSource": "A4V"` to get flow metadata in XML format

## ✅ Mandatory Best Practices
- **ALWAYS** follow the 3-step pipeline: fetchGroundedObjectMetadata → flowElementSelection → flowElementGeneration. This is the ONLY way to generate flow metadata. There are no alternatives.
- Do NOT manually create flow metadata XML, JSON, or any other format outside of this pipeline.
- Do NOT attempt to "optimize" by skipping steps or combining steps. Each step is atomic and required.
- **NEVER** skip any step in the pipeline. All 3 steps are required.
- **NEVER** try to generate flow metadata without calling all 3 steps.
- **NEVER** deviate from this pipeline under any circumstance — even if you think you know the flow structure.
- For single flow requests: you MUST use the user prompt as `userPrompt`.
- For multiple flow requests: you MUST run a separate 3-step pipeline for each flow.
- You MUST put flow requirements in `userPrompt`, NOT in `inflightMetadata`.
- `inflightMetadata` is ONLY for custom object/field metadata from local project (see above). No exceptions.
- Step 3 MUST be called in a loop with the same `operationId` from Step 2 until `isComplete` is `true`. Do NOT stop early.
- You MUST only extract the flow metadata from the `result` field when `isComplete` is `true`.

## 🚨 CRITICAL Verification Checklist (MUST VERIFY BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY FLOW GENERATION)

**Failure to follow this checklist exactly will result in broken or missing flow metadata.**

- [ ] **Pipeline**: ALL 3 steps are called in strict order (fetchGroundedObjectMetadata → flowElementSelection → flowElementGeneration). No step is skipped.
- [ ] **No manual metadata**: Flow metadata is NOT manually created, modified, or generated outside of this pipeline by any means
- [ ] **No deviation**: No alternative tools, APIs, or methods were used instead of or alongside this pipeline
- [ ] **userPrompt** contains a single flow prompt (split if user requested multiple flows)
- [ ] **userPrompt** is passed consistently to both Step 1 and Step 2 (same value)
- [ ] **inflightMetadata** is ARRAY data type (NOT string)
- [ ] **inflightMetadata** is `[]` when no custom objects needed
- [ ] **inflightMetadata** contains structured objects extracted by scanning the local sfdx project for relevant custom objects/fields
- [ ] **inflightMetadata** does NOT contain `"[]"` (string) - must be `[]` (array)
- [ ] **inflightMetadata** does NOT contain text descriptions or instructions
- [ ] **groundingMetadata** from Step 1 output is passed directly to Step 2 input (it is already a string — do NOT serialize it again)
- [ ] **operationId** from Step 2 output is passed to Step 3 input
- [ ] **requestSource** should be set to `"A4V"` always
- [ ] **Step 3** is called in a loop with the same `operationId` from Step 2 until `isComplete` is `true`
- [ ] **result** field is used to extract the XML flow metadata only when `isComplete` is `true`
